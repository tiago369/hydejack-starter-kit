# DOBOT  Magician pick and place

The work consisted of performing a pick and place, with the Dobot magician manipulator. This activity was guided by [Marco Reis](), which required it to be done using ROS, the problem is that the material in ROS for the manipulator is very precarious, causing the task to be performed in ROS Kinetic, a version already discontinued.

The material used to move the robotic arm can be found [here](https://hotblackrobotics.github.io/en/blog/2018/06/29/ros-dobot/). It consists of a package adapted from the demo for the official ROS of DOBOT, being chosen because the creator of this package made a specific topic to be able to control its position.

The problem with the Dobot in ROS is that it uses services to do any action. This causes the functionality of the manipulator to be very slow.

Some of its movement can be seen below:
